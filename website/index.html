  <h1 align="middle">Abstract</h1>
  <p>
    Soccer is not only the most popular sport in the world, but it also poses many interesting graphical and phyical
    challenges to simulate. In this project, we model and visualize the behavior of a soccer ball.
    We implemented a number of features in the physics simulator, including a truncated icosahedral spring-mass system
    to model the ball, internal air pressure forces to keep the ball inflated, collisions, and parametizable kicking
    action force, wind speed, and spin. Adding these forces together
    allowed us to create realistic physical qualities such as the bounce of a ball and realistic collisions between the
    ball and goal net. We render the scene making use of multiple shaders, modifying UV values, and setting surface
    normals for the ball mesh to create a visually appealing final product. We then used the simulator to model some
    free kicks.
  </p>

  <h1 align="middle">The Soccer Ball</h1>
  <h2 align="middle">Truncated Icosahedron</h2>
  <p>
    Polyhedral geometry allows us to mathematically model the shape of a soccer ball. In particular, a soccer ball is
    the shape of a <b>truncated icosahedron</b>. A truncated icosahedron is a semi-regular polyhedron with 32 faces, 90
    edges, and 60 vertices. Of the 32 faces, 12 of them are pentagons and 20 of them are hexagons. We modeled our soccer
    ball as a <b>spring-mass system</b> in the shape of a truncated icosahedron, with <b>point masses at each of the
      vertices</b> and <b>springs along each edge</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To understand what is a truncated icosahedron, let's first consider the icosahedron, a more familiar regular
    polyhedron. An icosahedron has 20 triangular faces, and 5 faces meet at each vertex, hence there are 12 vertices.
  </p>
  <p>
    Truncation refers to the process of "chopping off" each of the edges in such a way that the resulting figure has
    regular polygons as all of its new faces. A truncated polyhedron has hexagonal faces in place of the triangular
    faces on the original icosahedron, and pentagonal faces in place of each of the vertices of the original
    icosahedron. Each new vertex on the truncated icosahedron is the intersection of two hexagonal faces and one
    pentagonal face.
  </p>
  <p>

    picture of truncated icosahedron
  </p>
  <p>
    Because of the highly symmetric nature of the truncated icosahedron, there is a rather elegant closed-from solution
    for the locations of the vertices. Letting φ = (1 + √5)/2 represent the golden ratio, the vertices
    are all the even permutations of
  </p>
  <p>
    (0, ±1, ±3) [12 vertices]
  </p>
  <p>
    and even permutations of
  </p>
  <p>
    (±1, ±(2 + φ), ±2φ) [24 vertices]
  </p>
  <p>
    and even permutations of
  </p>
  <p>
    (±φ, ±2, ±(2φ + 1)) [24 vertices]
  </p>
  <p>
    An even permutation refers to a rearrangement in the (x, y, z) values that requires an even number of swaps. For
    example, given (0, 1, 3), we have that (1, 3, 0) is an even permutation, but (0, 3, 1) is not. While the formula
    above can be derived (with difficulty) by anyone with the background of 8th grade geometry, there is a rather
    elegant and intuitive interpretation of the shape geometry in the context of a group structure from abstract algebra
    [1]. We used [2] to help us model the geometry and create the json file with the vertex coordinates and which
    vertices are connected by edges.
  </p>

  <h2 align="middle">Air Pressure</h2>
  <p>
    A soccer ball is not a rigid body - it can flex and change shape depending on external forces.
    In real life, a ball is pumped with air to create internal air pressure. An uninflated ball is more easily
    deformable with your hands and does not bounce back when hitting the ground,
    wheras a ball that is fully inflated is likely to spring back up and does not deform as much.
  </p>
  <p>
    To model the effect of inflating the ball, we introduce two values: the <b>internal air pressure</b> and
    <b>centroid</b> of the ball.
    The <b>centroid</b> is calculated as the average (x, y, z) position of all the vertices of the ball. Since the model
    of the ball
    is a moving spring mass system where each particle is simulated independently, the centroid changes over time.
    The <b>internal air pressure</b> is a scalar parameter that determines how much internal force there is acting on
    the
    vertices, pushing the vertices away from the center.

    We define the force acting on each mass in the ball as:
  <pre align="middle">direction = pm.position - centroid</pre>
  <pre align="middle">magnitude = air_pressure / direction.norm()</pre>
  <pre align="middle">F_air(pm, centroid) = direction.unit() * magnitude</pre>
  This pushes every element in an outwards direction at a magnitude proportional to the air pressure inside the ball,
  while applying a greater force to point masses closer to centroid of the ball.
  The mathematical intuition behind this is that if the volume of the ball shrinks (radius decreases) because the ball
  is deformed, then the outward pressure on the deformed portion will increase because the total amount of air in
  the ball remains the same.
  </br>
  <b>Insert Photos Here</b>
  </br>
  Our simplified model of air pressure holds up well under various conditions. Above, we demonstrate three scenarios.
  We see that with no air pressure, the ball collapses in on itself - indicating the need for some internal force to
  keep the ball inflated. As we increase air pressure, we model what is a "flat" ball. The ball has more flex and
  bounce, and energy is lost in this process. Finally we look at a fully inflated ball (high internal air pressure).
  This ball has
  little noticable deformation, and retains most of the energy as it returns to a similar height.
  </p>
  <h1 align="middle">External Forces</h1>

  <h2 align="middle" <h2 align="middle">Wind</h2>
  <p>
    In soccer, external wind is a big factor in kicking a ball. Many times a gust of wind will blow a ball off course,
    and soccer players must account for this when aiming their shot. Wind is modeled as a “push”
    force which affect particles depending on the direction from which it approach the object. The main idea is that
    wind applies a stronger force on particles it hits head on, and the particles on the far side of the ball are
    blocked from the wind and experience no wind force. We came up with the following formula to characterize the wind
    force applied. Here, F_wind is a tunable parameter defined by a direction vector (gets normalized) and
    scalar magnitude.</p>

  <p>
  <pre align="middle">F_app = dot(–F_wind, (pt.position – centroid)) * F_wind </pre>

  <p>insert image here SBS with eqn </p>

  </p>
  The dot product between wind and direction from centroid gives us a cos(theta) term, where theta is the angle between
  the negative direction of the wind and the vector from the centroid to the surface point. The intuition is that if
  this angle is small (ie. the wind is hitting head on), the force should be larger, while if the angle is close to
  perpendicular (ie. the wind barely grazes the ball) then the force should be close to 0. Any points on the opposite
  side of the ball not hit by the wind do not experience any wind force. Additionally, unlike gravity, we enforce a
  terminal velocity due to wind. This makes sense intuitively as wind moving at a certain speed will accelerate the ball
  up to that speed, but not faster.


  <p> videos of curve</p>

  <p>
    The effects of adding wind can be seen in the curved movement of the soccer ball. Many skilled soccer players
    strategically kick the ball in this swooping manner during high-wind conditions to curve the ball around a defender.
  </p>

  <h2 align="middle">Spin</h2>

  <p>The next feature we implemented was the spin on the ball. The ball should appear to spin around the axis
    (ie. the point masses of the spring-mass system need to move relative to one another), but we needed to make sure
    that there was no overall external force on the ball that would affect the trajectory. As a result, we needed to
    take special care to design forces on each particle that would cause the ball to spin, but would cancel each other
    out over all the particles in the ball. Letting a be the unit vector spin axis and F_spin be a tuneable parameter,
    the formula below is what we came up with: </p>

  <p>
  <pre align="middle">F_app = cross(a, (pt.position – centroid)) * F_spin </pre>
  </p>

  <p>picture SBS</p>


  The intuition is that by taking the cross-product, we identify a direction for each particle perpendicular to the axis
  of rotation and tangent to the surface at the point. The cumulative effect of these forces at each point is that they
  will exert a net torque on the ball (causing it to spin), but zero net force. Like with the wind, there is a terminal
  angular velocity of the spin.</p>

  <p>videos</p>

  <h2 align="middle">Collisions</h2>
  <p>
    The next design challenge was to model collisions between the soccer ball, ground, and goal net. Collisions between
    the ball (system of point masses) and the ground (plane) were relatively straightforward, and we directly used the
    point-plane interactions from project 4 for this part. Howevever, collisions between the ball mesh and the goal net
    proved to be trickier. The first challenge was with the runtime - even with spatial hashing, the large number of
    point masses and forces in the scene meant a lot of computation would be required. Also, the truncated icosahedral
    spring-mass mesh is not actually a solid object - rather, there are gaps between the springs, where the faces should
    be. To account for both of these problems, we decided to represent our soccer ball as a sphere for the purposes of
    checking for ball-to-goal collisions. To do this, we define the sphere's origin and radius as follows:
  </p>
  <pre align="middle">origin = ∑ [pm.position] / n</pre>
  <pre align="middle">radius = max (pm.position - centroid)</pre>
  <p>
    Using this spherical representation, we can use the point in sphere test to check for collisions with the goal net.
    Computationally, this reduces the workload to a linear number of checks, just one for each pointmass on the goal
    net.
  </p>

  <p>pictures</p>

  <p>Above, we can see some collisions between the ball and the goal net. They approximate the truncated
    icosahedron with a sphere and still look quite natural.</p>

  <h1 align="middle">Visualization</h1>

  <h2 align="middle">Textures</h2>
  <p>
    For the soccer ball, we used a simple texture mapping that assigns black to the pentagonal faces and white to the
    hexagonal faces. Since texture mapping works with barycentric coordinates on a triangle, we needed to subdivide each
    face into triangles formed by connecting the center of the polygon to the pairs of adjacent vertices (5 triangles on
    the pentagon, 6 triangles on the hexagon). Further loop subdivision was not needed. To calculate the vertex normals
    at each vertex, we simply calculated a normalized vector from the centroid to the surface point mass on the
    truncated icosahedron.
  </p>


  <p> closeup of ball
  <p>The plane from the original project 4 library did not render high quality textures. To account
    for this, we added UV coordinates for the plane to properly sample from our texture image.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another visualization feature we implemented was a 360° scene. We aimed for this scene should look like a
    stadium and be viewable from all angles without seams or gaps. While we originally tried to implement a skybox [3]
    that follows the camera and shows the background texture whenever there isn't any other obstruction, we found this
    to be rather cumbersome to implement and led to issues that were difficult to debug. Accordingly, after spending
    several days trying, we decided to instead use a large sphere surrounding the scene and texture map a 360 degree
    panorama image onto the sphere "sky". While not completely robust (i.e. one can still zoom out enough and end up
    outside the sphere), this approach looks realistic enough for the standard ranges of values and doesn't take away
    from the physical simulation.
  </p>

  <h2 align="middle">Goal Net</h2>
  <p>
    The goal net was created by taking a single large rectangular grid and bending the net at various points.
    We created 4 total components: two sides, a back, and a top of the net. To achieve this bending, we used
    a piecewise function f(row, col): (x,y,z) to determine the position of each point mass.
    </br>
    </br>
    Some challenges faced in the goal net were: finding the right indices at which to bend each component, removing
    springs from specific edge cases to prevent unwanted forces in the corners, and segmentation faults that
    occur when trying to make non-rectangular cloth meshes. We can define the goal box to have dimensions L x H x S.
    To do this, we can fold a 2D cloth of size (2 * S + L) x (H + S)
    To create the piecewise value of position.xyz we have the follow set of equations.
    <br>
    If row <= H: <pre>
      position.x += max(0, min(l, col - s)) * step
      position.z += step * min(col, a) - step * max(0, col - (l + s))
      position.y += row * step
      </pre>
      If row > H:
      <pre>
    long x_diff = min(max(0, col - a), l)
    long y_diff = 0.5 * min(col, a) - step * max(0, col - (l + a))
    position.x += step * x_diff
    position.z += step * (row + 1);
    position.y += y_diff
  </pre>
  </p>
  <h1>Challenges and Learnings</h1>
  One key challenge we faced was with compatibility issues of the simulator code on different machines. Only two of our
  group members' computers were able to run the code, so we would usually meet up to pair program when we wanted to test
  our implementations. The main design challenges, as discussed above, were coming up with the physics models that could
  accurately model the dynamics of the scene. We typically had to sketch out several ideas on paper first before trying
  and implementing them, and needed to be extra careful when converting our math equations into code. After implementing
  the base skeleton, we would often also have to continually tweak parameters to get the desired behavior/visual
  effects. Fianlly, making realistic-looking collisions was also very challenging but we eventually settled on the
  solutions described above. Some key takeaways for us from this project was that simple, intuitive models often worked
  best in complex scenarios. We should never underestimate the power of creating simple models and allowing the physics
  to play out to end up with something that looks realistic.
